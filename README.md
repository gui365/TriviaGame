# MOVIES Trivia Game

This project was the homework for week 5 of the Penn Coding Boot Camp. The goal was to create a multiple choice trivia game and apply knowledge on timers and intervals.

## Challenge
* Create a trivia game using JavaScript. When the game starts, a question is randomly selected and a timer starts counting down. An answer is chosen and a message informs if the answer is correct or incorrect. If the time runs out and the user didn't make a choice, the answer is considered incorrect.
After 5 questions, a summary comes up telling the user how well they did.
